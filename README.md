# Hermes MAX Platform Plugin

MAX Messenger platform adapter for Hermes Agent.

This plugin lets Hermes receive and send messages through MAX (`max.ru`) using
either webhook delivery or long polling. It supports text, markdown formatting,
attachments, images, files, voice/audio, video, inline keyboards, callback
events, typing/read actions, and cron notification delivery to a default chat.

## Features

- Inbound messages through webhook or polling.
- Outbound text with automatic chunking for MAX message limits.
- Markdown-compatible formatting for bold, italic, strikethrough, code, links,
  and headings.
- Images, files, audio/voice, and video delivery.
- Inline keyboard attachments from send metadata.
- Callback event handling.
- Optional allow-list for permitted MAX user IDs.
- Optional default chat for cron and notification delivery.

## Requirements

- Hermes Agent with platform plugin support.
- Python package: `aiohttp`.
- A MAX bot token.

`platform-api2.max.ru`'s TLS cert chains to the Russian Ministry of Digital
Development's own root CA, which isn't in the standard system/Mozilla trust
store. The `ca/` directory bundles the official root+sub certs (from
`gu-st.ru`, the Mintsifry-operated distribution host) and the adapter
extends (not replaces) the default trust store with them — no extra system
CA installation needed on the host running Hermes.

Install the runtime dependency in the same environment that runs Hermes:

```bash
pip install aiohttp
```

## Installation

This is a third-party (Plugin Path) adapter, not a bundled/core one — per
Hermes's own `gateway/platforms/ADDING_A_PLATFORM.md`, third-party plugins
belong directly under `~/.hermes/plugins/<name>/`, **not**
`~/.hermes/plugins/platforms/<name>/` (that `platforms/` subdirectory is
reserved for adapters bundled with Hermes itself — the plugin scanner keys
a user-installed plugin by its directory name one level down from
`~/.hermes/plugins/`, so installing under `platforms/max` registers a
platform key of `platforms/max` instead of `max`, and the adapter silently
never loads).

The simplest correct install is via the Hermes CLI, which handles the path
for you:

```bash
hermes plugins install <your-repo-url-or-owner/repo>
hermes plugins enable max
```

Equivalent manual install:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/.hermes/plugins/max
hermes plugins enable max
```

Then restart the gateway (`hermes gateway restart`) for it to pick up the
newly enabled platform.

## Configuration

The plugin reads configuration from Hermes platform config and from environment
variables. Environment variables take precedence for deployment-specific values.

Required:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `MAX_BOT_TOKEN` | MAX bot token used as the API `Authorization` header. |

Optional:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `MAX_TRANSPORT` | `webhook` or `polling`. Defaults to `webhook` when `MAX_WEBHOOK_URL` is set, otherwise `polling`. |
| `MAX_WEBHOOK_URL` | Public HTTPS webhook URL registered with MAX, for example `https://example.com/max/webhook`. MAX expects external HTTPS on port 443. |
| `MAX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Secret validated against `X-Max-Bot-Api-Secret` on webhook requests. |
| `MAX_WEBHOOK_HOST` | Local webhook bind host. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`. |
| `MAX_WEBHOOK_PORT` | Local webhook listen port. Defaults to `8650`. |
| `MAX_WEBHOOK_PATH` | Local webhook path. Defaults to `/max/webhook`. |
| `MAX_UPDATE_TYPES` | Comma-separated update types. Defaults to `message_created,message_callback,bot_started`. |
| `MAX_API_BASE_URL` | MAX Bot API base URL. Defaults to `https://platform-api2.max.ru` (the pre-2026-07-19 host, `platform-api.max.ru`, is retired — override only for tests, proxies, or compatible endpoints). |
| `MAX_ALLOWED_USERS` | Comma-separated MAX user IDs allowed to talk to the bot. |
| `MAX_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` | Set to `true` to allow any MAX user. Intended for development only. |
| `MAX_HOME_CHANNEL` | Default chat ID for cron and notification delivery. |
| `MAX_HOME_CHANNEL_NAME` | Optional display name for the home channel. |
| `MAX_HOME_CHANNEL_THREAD_ID` | Optional thread ID for home channel delivery metadata. |

## Webhook Mode

Webhook mode starts a local `aiohttp` server and registers the public webhook URL
with MAX.

Typical deployment shape:

1. Run Hermes with `MAX_TRANSPORT=webhook`.
2. Bind the plugin locally, for example `0.0.0.0:8650/max/webhook`.
3. Put a reverse proxy in front of it.
4. Expose the public URL over HTTPS on port 443.
5. Set `MAX_WEBHOOK_URL` to that public URL.

Example:

```bash
export MAX_BOT_TOKEN="..."
export MAX_TRANSPORT="webhook"
export MAX_WEBHOOK_URL="https://example.com/max/webhook"
export MAX_WEBHOOK_SECRET="change-me"
export MAX_WEBHOOK_HOST="0.0.0.0"
export MAX_WEBHOOK_PORT="8650"
export MAX_WEBHOOK_PATH="/max/webhook"
```

## Polling Mode

Polling mode does not require a public endpoint. It periodically reads updates
from the MAX API.

```bash
export MAX_BOT_TOKEN="..."
export MAX_TRANSPORT="polling"
```

If `MAX_TRANSPORT` is omitted and `MAX_WEBHOOK_URL` is not set, polling is used.

## Outbound Media

Hermes can send local files through platform adapters. When replying through
MAX, use an absolute local file path in a `MEDIA:` directive when Hermes needs
to deliver a generated file:

```text
MEDIA:/absolute/path/to/file.png
```

Audio files such as `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, and `.ogg` are delivered as
native audio/voice attachments by default (or as files/documents when `force_document` is set).

## Inline Keyboards

The adapter supports inline keyboards in two ways.

Use inline keyboards when the user needs to choose a short action or open a
link. Keep them compact, usually 2-4 buttons. Do not add buttons to ordinary
informational replies.

Hermes `clarify` prompts with choices are rendered as native MAX inline
buttons automatically. Button taps unblock the waiting agent turn through the
standard Hermes clarify flow.

For ordinary Hermes replies, include a MAX-specific directive in the outgoing
text. The adapter removes the directive before sending and converts it to a
native MAX `inline_keyboard` attachment:

```html
Choose an action:
<!-- max_buttons: [[{"text":"Continue","payload":"continue"}],[{"text":"Open","url":"https://example.com"}],[{"text":"Copy","copy":"text for clipboard"}]] -->
```

Button shorthands:

- `{ "text": "Continue", "payload": "continue" }` → MAX `callback` button
- `{ "text": "Open", "url": "https://example.com" }` → MAX `link` button
- `{ "text": "Copy", "copy": "text for clipboard" }` → MAX `clipboard` button
- raw MAX button objects also pass through, e.g. `{ "type": "clipboard", "text": "Copy", "payload": "text for clipboard" }`

For manual testing, the same JSON can be written as a fenced block:

````markdown
Choose an action:
```max_buttons
[[{"text":"Continue","payload":"continue"}]]
```
````

Programmatic sends can also pass MAX-specific metadata. Supported metadata
shapes include:

```python
{
    "max_inline_keyboard": [
        [{"text": "Open", "url": "https://example.com"}],
        [{"text": "Pick", "payload": "resume:123"}],
    ]
}
```

or raw MAX attachments:

```python
{
    "max_attachments": [
        {"type": "inline_keyboard", "payload": {"buttons": [[...]]}}
    ]
}
```

## Localization

The native command menu (`/help`, `/model`, etc. — see `MAX_NATIVE_COMMANDS`
in `adapter.py`) ships with Russian **descriptions** by default; the command
**names** stay English on purpose. MAX's command menu only stores a `name` +
`description` pair — `name` is the literal slash-command trigger, and
Hermes's gateway dispatcher (`gateway/run.py`) matches incoming text against
a fixed set of canonical English command names. Translating `name` would
show a nice Russian trigger in MAX's UI, but tapping it sends text the
dispatcher doesn't recognize and the command silently no-ops. Only
`description` — pure display text with no effect on dispatch — is safe to
translate, so that's the only field this plugin localizes.

For a full reference of every Hermes gateway command (not just the 12 in
MAX's menu) with Russian descriptions, see [`COMMANDS.ru.md`](COMMANDS.ru.md).

For everything Hermes says *beyond* the command menu — approval prompts,
restart/drain notices, and the replies of several built-in slash commands —
Hermes ships its own translation catalog (`agent/i18n.py`,
`locales/<lang>.yaml`), independent of this plugin, and Russian (`ru`) is
already a supported, essentially complete catalog (as of this writing,
`locales/ru.yaml` is 416 lines against 428 in `locales/en.yaml`). It's not
wired to MAX specifically — it recolors every platform Hermes talks on at
once (Telegram, Discord, CLI, MAX, ...). Because it's global rather than
MAX-specific, this plugin does **not** turn it on for you at install time;
opt in yourself by adding to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
display:
  language: ru
```

Restart the gateway (`hermes gateway restart`) afterward. Note `/whoami`'s
reply specifically is not yet migrated into this catalog (it's an f-string
in `gateway/slash_commands.py`), so it stays English even with `language: ru`
set — everything else covered by the catalog will switch.

## Development

Useful checks:

```bash
python -m py_compile adapter.py __init__.py
git status --short
```

This repository is maintained as an independent MAX platform plugin for Hermes.
The earliest implementation was imported from the public
`MaZzZilka/hermes-max-plugin` repository and then substantially reworked for
webhook support, media delivery, callbacks, chunking, and Hermes gateway
integration.
